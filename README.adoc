== 1. What is CloudUnit
CloudUnit is an open source PaaS based on docker to automating build and deployment of your java application. Cloudunit can deploy all java application type and it is a RESTful application. CloudUnit includes a list of useful services like Elasticsearch, MondoDB, Postgresql, etc. Deployment can be on CLI or Web view.
You can also install CloudUnit on a server. If you want to install ClodUnit to a server, you have some requirements.


== 2. Getting started
Picking the right solution can help you get a CloudUnit application up and running, either for local development. Setting Up / Delpoying CloudUnit Applications
Go to: https://cu01.cloudunit.io to begin.

=== 2.1. Logging
Logging is composed by *<Username>* and *<Password>*. If you want to use private CloudUnit PaaS, you must contact Treeptik to open an account.

Let's begging...
This sample is for public user in order to test CloudUnit. This <id> is not a root user so your privileged is restricted. To have root account you must create new account given by Treeptik.

 Username: johndoe
 Password: abc2015
 > login

=== 2.2. Create first application
The first step is to create an application base on java application. First, choose application server and giving a name. Let's  run a sample jsp page by .war file via CloudUnit. To make that, we need a Apache tomcat serveur in our application.

.create Apache Tomcat server:
----

*App Name*: testTomcat // <1>
*App Server*: Tomcat 8.0.39 // <2>
*'Create new application'*. // <3>

----
<1> name given for your application
<2> list of available server
<3> button create

'''

image::./img/testTomcat_1.jpg[align= center]

=== 2.2. Manage application
Manage application gives ability to the user to add modules, deploy applications, explore services, check logs, monitoring, setting jvm configuration, variables environments, associate volumes, run commands.
The application that you create can be attached with anoter services call *module*.

.Manage serveur application and add module:
----

1. App Name: testTomcat // <1>
2. choose Manage // <2>

----
<1> give it a name, here the sample name is testTomcat
<2> Validate *'MANAGE'*

'''

image::./img/testTomcat_2.jpg[align= center]

[WARNING]
===============================
- update link https://cu03.cloudunit.io/ instead of https://cu01.cloudunit.io/
===============================


==== 2.2.1. Overview
Overview application stand to describe all information of the current application. You can also see all added modules on the application and all confgurations.

image::./img/manageapp.jpg[align= center]

----

1. your application // <1>
2. module added // <2>

----
<1> All can have all the details of your application here, like creation date, server's name, JVM, server console admin, etc).
<2> The module added to your application and all details about it. You can have many modules. e.g: here with have elasticsearch 2.4 modules added into tomcat server.

[IMPORTANT]
===============================
- application's name is composed by <appName>-<moduleName>-<id>
- host url
- activate or desactivate port's modulefgh
- adding environment variables
===============================


==== 2.2.2. Module
You can see modules as a service that depends on your application, it is usually a database like elasticserch, postgresql, mysql, etc.

image::./img/module.jpg[align= center]

----

1. module section selected // <1>
2. list of available modules // <2>

----
<1> selected module page
<2> list of available modules that you can add to your application.


'''

==== 2.2.3. Deploy
Deploying application in CloudUnit can be do in two ways:

* deploy by local source .ear or .war
* deploy by url

image::./img/deploy.jpg[align= center]

----

1. deploy as a .war or .ear (local) // <1>
2. deploy to host // <2>

----
<1> here you can add your web archive application to deploy.
<2> you can paste the url of your application here.


'''

==== 2.2.4. Explorer

image::./img/explorer.jpg[align= center]

----

1. file explorer: you can choose between your application or your modules // <1>
2. tree of your application // <2>
2. manage your directory (filter, upload file, add/remove file or directory,...) // <3>

----
<1> select your application here to show details.
<2> Tree of the directory.
<3> manipulate directory.


'''


==== 2.2.5. Logs
==== 2.2.6. Monitoring
==== 2.2.7. Create template
You can create a template for your application.

image::./img/template.jpg[align= center]

----

1. snapshot name // <1>
2. editor// <2>
2. validate // <3>

----
<1> snapshot is the name of the template, it refers as the name and version of the template.
<2> editor include tools to build template.
<3> button validation to create one template.


'''

==== 2.2.8. Settings
JVM Configuration::
    You can scale the memory of the container between 512 mo and 4096 mo, and you can also ad a Dkey=value

image::./img/jvmConfig.jpg[align= center]

ENV Configuration::
    Variables Environment can be configured too. You can add, update, and delete variable of your application.

image::./img/env.jpg[align= center]

Volume association::
    Your application can be link with another container by path name in order to work together.

image::./img/env.jpg[align= center]

Command run::
    You can launch command docker run.

image::./img/run.jpg[align= center]


=== 2.3. Deploying my first CloudUnit app: Tomcat-helloWorld.jsp

[IMPORTANT]
===============================
- make sure that you are logged into public account 'johndoe' (see 2.1 logging),
- make sure that you have a .war or .ear file if not check here : https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/sample/
===============================
- create tomcat version 8.X application and name it,
- add module mysql version x.x,
- configure your tomcat, activate port,
- configure your mysql, activate port,
- in deploy section, select your sample.war
- open browser to check the result.

== 3. Concepts, Tasks, and Tutorials
The CloudUnit documentation contains a number of resources to help you understand and work with CloudUnit.
Concepts provide a deep understanding of how CloudUnit works.
Tasks contain step-by-step instructions for common CloudUnit tasks.
Tutorials contain detailed walkthroughs of the CloudUnit workflow.

=== 3.1. Dashboard
In dashboard view, you can see your created application and its details. Each application is a service and each service contains one or more modules. Dashboard offer user a simple overview of all services and informations about his module.

=== 3.2. Add templates
Adding template to your server in order to assist users.

=== 3.3. Messages
Message is the console log of your application. All information about your server appeared here, such as creation, deleting, updating, and else.
This section useful for developers in order to debug his application and all attached services.

=== 3.4. Scripting

=== 3.5. Volumes
Volume is a repository mapped by your application. You can create, delete and add directory to your application.

=== 3.6. Monitoring
Monitoring shows all of metrics from your application which can be system metrics, docker container metrics, http metrics, etc.

=== 3.7. Portal

=== 3.8. CloudUnit-CLI guide (Command Line Interface)

This guide is for a user who want to use CloudUnit with command line interface.

==== 3.8.1. Requirements

For use this application, you need to have installed before :

   Default if specified:   '__NULL__'
   Default if unspecified: ''
* connect - Connect to CloudUnit Host


If you give a pattern in argument, the help command provides you commands with this pattern :

 CloudUnit-DEV-myapp>  help rm
* rm-alias - Remove an existing alias
* rm-app - Remove an application
* rm-module - Remove a module from the current application
* rm-snapshot - Remove the snapshot for the current application

==== 3.8.4. Connection

You can connect to the CloudUnit Manager with the command :

 CloudUnit-cli> connect --login johndoe
Enter your password : ****
Trying to connect to default CloudUnit host...
Connection established

IMPORTANT: host is localhost(/127.0.0.1) but you can specify if you want an external host with the command :

 CloudUnit-cli> connect --login johndoe --host https://admin.CloudUnit.dev
Enter your password :

Trying to connect to default CloudUnit host...
Connection established

Now you are in the DEV context.
